# AI for Drug Discovery: Antifungal Drug

## Overview
This project leverages **artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)** techniques to aid in antifungal drug discovery. The notebook explores computational approaches for predicting drug efficacy, molecular docking, and screening potential antifungal compounds.

## Objectives
- Utilize **AI and ML algorithms** for antifungal drug prediction.
- Implement **cheminformatics techniques** to analyze molecular structures.
- Perform **virtual screening** and molecular docking to identify promising drug candidates.
- Integrate **bioinformatics and AI tools** for enhanced drug discovery.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling and cleaning molecular datasets.
- **Descriptor Calculation**: Extracting molecular features using cheminformatics libraries.
- **Machine Learning Model Training**: Building classification/regression models to predict antifungal activity.
- **Molecular Docking**: Screening candidate drugs against fungal protein targets.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of compound efficacy and docking scores.


### Required Libraries
- **Python (>=3.8)**
- `numpy`, `pandas` – Data handling


## Usage
### 1. Load and Prepare Data
- The dataset contains antifungal drug molecules with activity labels.
- Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, normalization, and feature extraction.

### 2. classification Machine Learning Models
- Create  classification model  to classify antifungal potential based on IC50 value.


## Results
- The AI-driven model successfully classify promising active antifungal compounds based on inhibitory concentration used to kill 50% of fungi (IC50).

## Future Improvements
- Enhance model performance with deep learning techniques.
- Expand dataset with more diverse antifungal compounds.
- Integrate structural bioinformatics for advanced drug-target interactions.
